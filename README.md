Expose: an IDS for PHP
=========================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/enygma/expose.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/enygma/expose)
![Insight Rating](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/225eb78a-5af9-4ded-891c-6f04fb709362/small.png)

Expose is an Intrusion Detection System for PHP loosely based on the PHPIDS project (and using it's ruleset
for detecting potential threats).

**ALL CREDIT** for the rule set for Expose goes to the PHP IDS project. Expose literally
uses the same JSON configuration for its execution. I am not claiming any kind of ownership
or authorship of these rules. Please see [the PHPIDS github README](https://github.com/PHPIDS/PHPIDS)
for names of those who have contributed.

**NOTE:** An IDS system should not be relied upon for sole protection in your environment! It should only be used in
the first level of threat identification. Please read up on "[Defense in Depth](http://websec.io/2012/10/12/Core-Concepts-Defense-in-Depth.html)"
for more information on a layered security approach.

**Example usage:**

```php
<?php

$data = array(
    'POST' => array(
        'test' => 'foo',
        'bar' => array(
            'baz' => 'quux',
            'testing' => '<script>test</script>'
        )
    )
);

//cache
$cache = new Expose\Cache\File();
$cache->setPath( "cache-folder-path");

// with cache
$filters = new \Expose\FilterCollection($cache);
// without cache
// $filters = new \Expose\FilterCollection();
$filters->load();

//instantiate a PSR-3 compatible logger
$logger = new \Expose\Log\Mongo();

$manager = new \Expose\Manager($filters, $logger);
// with cache
$manager->setCache($cache);
$manager->run($data);

echo 'impact: '.$manager->getImpact()."\n"; // should return 8

// get all matching filter reports
$reports = $manager->getReports();
print_r($reports);

// export out the report in the given format ("text" is default)
echo $manager->export();
echo "\n\n";
?>
```
